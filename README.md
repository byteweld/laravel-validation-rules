# Laravel Validation Rules Package

A package to add custom validation rules for Laravel, including country-based phone number validation.

## ðŸš€ Features
- Country-based phone number validation.
- International phone number validation.
- Easy integration with Laravel validation.
- Supports multiple countries (more coming soon).

---

## ðŸ“¦ Installation
You can install the package via Composer:

```sh
composer require byteweld/laravel-validation-rules
```

After installation, Laravel will automatically discover the service provider.

If you're using Laravel <5.5, you need to add the service provider manually in `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    Byteweld\ValidationRules\Providers\ValidationServiceProvider::class,
],
```

---

## ðŸ›  Usage
You can use the validation rules in Laravelâ€™s validation system.

### ðŸ“ž Country-Based Phone Number Validation
#### Rule: `phone_number:{country}`
This rule validates a phone number based on country-specific criteria.

#### Example Usage
```php
$request->validate([
    'phone' => 'required|phone_number:india',
]);
```

#### Validation Logic for India
âœ… Must contain **only numbers**  
âœ… Length must be **exactly 10 digits**  
âœ… Must start with **6, 7, 8, or 9**

### ðŸŒŽ International Phone Number Validation
#### Rule: `international_phone_number:{country}`
This rule validates international phone numbers according to country-specific formats.

#### Example Usage
```php
$request->validate([
    'phone' => 'required|international_phone_number:india',
]);
```

#### Validation Logic for India
âœ… Must contain **only numbers**  
âœ… Length must be **exactly 13 characters**  
âœ… Must start with **+91** followed by a **10-digit mobile number**  
âœ… The number must start with **6, 7, 8, or 9**
